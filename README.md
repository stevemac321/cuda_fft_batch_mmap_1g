## ðŸš€ `cuda_fft_batch_mmap_1gb`
## TODO - grab SVM stuff from DSPServer, copy in CMSIS-DSP, demo the big logfile compared to memory mapped files, add the .json code that captures all the global FFT data to pass to Matplotlib##
### Overview

This project processes high-throughput voltage telemetry collected from STM32F4xx microcontrollers. It performs batched FFT analysis on 1GB of data using CUDA, (TODO applies anomaly detection via CMSIS-DSP and scikit-learn SVM), and generates detailed signal reports with Matplotlib. Performance metrics are captured using CUDA Insight and Visual Studio debugging tools.

### ðŸ”§ Pipeline Summary

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Voltage packets streamed from STM32F4xx MCUs
   - Stored as binary float32 arrays via memory-mapped files
   - 12 files Ã— 16MB = 192MB per batch (scaled to 1GB in full runs)

2. **FFT Processing**
   - (TODO run the raw voltage chunk thru outlier detection)
   - CUDA FFT on 128-float chunks (393216 rows per 192MB batch)
   - cuFFT throughput: ~106 ms for 50M+ floats
   - Frequency domain features extracted per chunk

3. **Signal Statistics (per chunk)**
   - Max Voltage  
   - Min Voltage  
   - Voltage Range  
   - Mean Voltage  
   - Standard Deviation (Noise Level)
